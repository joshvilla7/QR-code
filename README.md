How the solution looks on a full size desktop window. 



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

With this project I was able to learn more about HTML divs and CSS markup to create my own QR code for my Youtube channel. Getting everything to line up the way I wanted was a challenge but I am happy with the result. Still a lot of work to be done with it to be perfected, but I wanted this to be a quick project where I could practice my CSS skills. Hope you enjoy the content!



### Continued development

The version of this QR code is only optimized for full screen window desktop/laptop screens. It needs to be adjusted for mobile screens and when you shrink down the browser window. This is something I plan on coming back too, to optimize for smaller/adjusting screen sizes. Right now it's best viewed on a regular laptop/desktop screen.
